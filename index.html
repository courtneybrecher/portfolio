                <h3>Cloudvirga dashboard design</h3>
                <p>
                    Last summer, I interned as a UX designer at Cloudvirga, a fintech startup 
                    focused on simplifying the home loan and credit card application processes. 
                    One of my key projects involved collaborating with the design team to redesign 
                    Cloudvirga’s platform, aligning it with the company’s updated branding, values, 
                    and mission. A primary goal of the redesign was to encourage users to complete 
                    their home loan applications. I played an integral role in every stage of the 
                    design process, from participating in regular design reviews to revising Figma 
                    files to improve the user interface. I also ensured the site met ADA compliance 
                    standards, creating a more inclusive experience for all users.

                <h3>Spotify Case Study</h3>
                <p>
                    Created a new feature for Spotify by using the Double Diamond Framework in
                    order to build a design to promote community building with a clear user
                    interface using Figma. Participated in a critique group to peer review student products and provide feedback.

                <p>
                    Collaborated with a partner to develop a dynamic version of Connect 4 with any number of rows and columns. 
                    Gained experienced with using both 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional data, structuring code with 
                    inheritance and subclasses, and writing code for simple artificial intelligence.

                    Self-coded my own website to raise awareness about challenges for the
