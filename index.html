            <p>
                Hi! My name is Courtney I'm from New York, and I'm currently a sophomore at Cornell University in the College of Engineering class of 2027. 
                I'm majoring in computer science with a minor in information science, concentrating in UX design. Throughout my time at Cornell, 
                I hope to build upon my technical skills regarding programming and design skills as well as develop a strong set of professional skills.
                In future projects, I hope to use my skillset to directly benefit my community. I am a team-oriented worker and look forward to 
                collaborating with other engineers to build meaningful projects. If you are interested in my work feel free to explore my 
                portfolio and reach out to me! cpb93@cornell.edu

                <h3>Spotify Case Study</h3>
                <p>
                    Created a new feature for Spotify by using the Double Diamond Framework in
                    order to build a design to promote community building with a clear user
                    interface using Figma. Participated in a critique group to peer review student products and provide feedback.

                <h3>Connect-N</h3>
                <p>
                    Collaborated with a partner to develop a dynamic version of Connect 4 with any number of rows and columns. 
                    Gained experienced with using both 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional data, structuring code with 
                    inheritance and subclasses, and writing code for simple artificial intelligence.
