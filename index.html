                <p>Hi! My name is Courtney. I'm from New York, and I'm currently a junior at Cornell University in the College of Engineering class of 2027. Throughout my time at Cornell, I hope to build upon my technical skills regarding programming and design skills as well as develop a strong set of professional skills. In future projects, I hope to use my skillset to directly benefit my community. I am a team-oriented worker and look forward to collaborating with other engineers to build meaningful projects. If you are interested in my work, feel free to explore my portfolio and reach out to me at cpb93@cornell.edu.</p>

        <h3>Battleship Game – Functional Programming</h3>
        <p>Collaborated on a functional reimagining of the classic Battleship game using OCaml, emphasizing data abstraction and immutability. Themed around a mermaid lagoon, the game includes both two-player and single-player modes with difficulty-scaled AI, point tracking, and terminal-based interactions.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Built gameplay logic for firing, hit detection, sunk treasures, and win conditions</li>
            <li>Developed comprehensive test suites and input error handling</li>
            <li>Implemented point system and user commands like <code>view</code> and <code>quit</code></li>
            <li>Created a clean TUI with flushed screen turns and visual hit/miss feedback</li>
            <li>Extended game with AI ship-placement for easy, medium, and hard difficulty</li>
        </ul>

                        <h3>Interactive Image Selection</h3>
                        <p>This project focused on implementing and optimizing the Intelligent Scissors algorithm for interactive image segmentation, allowing users to select and trace paths that follow image edges for precise selections. I implemented Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the shortest paths in a weighted graph, adapting it for incremental updates to visualize the selection process dynamically. This approach enabled real-time feedback, allowing users to adjust paths and control points interactively. The final tool seamlessly combines edge-following and straight-line path options, offering flexibility and high accuracy in selections. With background processing and real-time updates, the tool maintained a smooth, responsive user experience. The project highlighted advanced algorithm design, data structure optimization, and real-time system performance.</p>

                        <h3>Connect-N</h3>
                        <p>Collaborated with a partner to develop a dynamic version of Connect 4 with any number of rows and columns. Gained experience with using both 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional data, structuring code with inheritance and subclasses, and writing code for simple artificial intelligence.</p>

                    <h3>Cloudvirga Dashboard Design</h3>
                    <p>Last summer, I interned as a UX designer at Cloudvirga, a fintech startup focused on simplifying the home loan and credit card application processes. One of my key projects involved collaborating with the design team to redesign Cloudvirga’s platform, aligning it with the company’s updated branding, values, and mission. A primary goal of the redesign was to encourage users to complete their home loan applications. I played an integral role in every stage of the design process, from participating in regular design reviews to revising Figma files to improve the user interface. I also ensured the site met ADA compliance standards, creating a more inclusive experience for all users.</p>
